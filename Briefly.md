# IMDb Reviews Sentiment Analysis Presentation

## 1. How did you vectorize the reviews? / Justify your choice of algorithm?

- **TextBlob Sentiment Analysis**: 
  - The reviews were analyzed using the TextBlob library, which provides a simple API for common natural language processing tasks.
  - TextBlob uses a predefined set of algorithms to calculate the sentiment polarity of the text, returning a score between -1 (negative) and 1 (positive).
  - **Justification**:
    - **Ease of Use**: TextBlob is easy to implement and requires minimal setup.
    - **Pre-trained Models**: It uses pre-trained models, saving time and resources.
    - **Accuracy**: It offers a good balance between accuracy and simplicity for basic sentiment analysis tasks.

## 2. How would you calculate the accuracy of your sentiment predictor?

- **Collect Labeled Data**: 
  - Gather a dataset with reviews that have been manually labeled with sentiment scores (positive, negative, neutral).
- **Split Data**: 
  - Divide the dataset into training and testing sets.
- **Train a Model**: 
  - Use the labeled training data to train a sentiment analysis model (if using machine learning).
- **Predictions**:
  - Use the trained model to predict sentiment on the test data or apply TextBlob to both training and test sets.
- **Evaluate**:
  - Compare predicted sentiment labels with actual labels.
  - Calculate metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.

## 3. How would you calculate the speed of inference?

- **Timing the Inference**:
  - Use Python's `time` module to measure the time taken for the sentiment analysis of each review.
  - Example:
    ```python
    import time
    start_time = time.time()
    sentiment = TextBlob(review_text).sentiment.polarity
    end_time = time.time()
    inference_time = end_time - start_time
    ```
  - **Average Inference Time**:
    - Process multiple reviews and calculate the average time per review to get a better estimate.
  - **Profiling Tools**:
    - Use more advanced profiling tools like `cProfile` to get detailed insights into the performance.

## 4. What would be your next steps to improve the solution?

- **Improve Data Quality**:
  - Use a larger and more diverse dataset to train the sentiment analysis model.
  - Manually label more data to improve accuracy.
- **Algorithm Enhancement**:
  - Experiment with more sophisticated NLP models such as BERT, GPT, or other deep learning models.
  - Use libraries like `NLTK`, `spaCy`, or `transformers` for advanced preprocessing and modeling.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**:
  - Perform hyperparameter tuning to optimize model performance.
- **Feature Engineering**:
  - Include more features such as review length, presence of certain keywords, and part-of-speech tags.
- **Model Ensemble**:
  - Combine multiple models to create an ensemble model that can improve accuracy and robustness.
- **Performance Optimization**:
  - Optimize code for faster execution, potentially using parallel processing for large datasets.
- **Deploy and Monitor**:
  - Deploy the solution as a web service and monitor its performance in real-time to continuously improve.
